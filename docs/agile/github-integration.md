# GitHub Integration

This repo uses GitHub as the agile execution layer.

## Issues

Use issue templates for:

- Feature work
- Bugs
- Chores

Suggested labels:

- `feature`, `bug`, `chore`, `research`
- `needs-triage`, `needs-refinement`, `ready`, `blocked`
- `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`
- `area:home`, `area:heroes`, `area:api`, `area:database`, `area:docs`, `area:ci`

## Pull Requests

Every PR should include:

- Summary
- Type of change
- Verification result
- Linked issue when applicable
- Follow-up risk if anything remains

Path-based labels are applied by `.github/workflows/pull-request-labeler.yml`.

## Actions

`CI` runs on PRs and pushes to `main`:

```text
npm ci
npm run build
```

The build currently enforces Angular budget limits. If a PR fails because a component CSS file exceeds budget, either reduce CSS or create an explicit chore to change the budget policy.

## Agents

Use `AGENTS.md` for coding-agent instructions and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot-style context.

Recommended agent assignment flow:

1. Create or refine an issue.
2. Add acceptance criteria.
3. Assign the issue to an agent or open a working branch.
4. Require a PR with CI passing.
5. Review against the Ready and Done checklists in `docs/agile/README.md`.

## Branch Naming

Suggested pattern:

```text
type/short-description
```

Examples:

```text
feature/agile-github-integration
bug/heroes-layout-budget
chore/css-budget-reduction
```
